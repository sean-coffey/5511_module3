# CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project

## Introduction

### Kaggle Competition Background - The Problem Statement

https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/overview

In this competition, you must create an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. Submissions are evaluated on **area under the ROC curve** between the predicted probability and the observed target. For each id in the test set, you must predict a probability that **centre 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue**. The file should contain a header and follow the format of "sample_submission.csv".

### Project Guidelines

As a mini-project to complete as a weekly assignment, we don't expect you to iterate over your project until you have a model capable of winning the challenge. The learner needs to show a score that reasonably reflects that they completed the rubric parts of this project. The grades are more based on the quality and depth of the analysis, not just on a better Kaggle score.

- Deliverable 1 — A Jupyter notebook with a description of the problem/data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion.
- Deliverable 2 — A public project GitHub repository with your work (please also include the GitHub repo URL in your notebook/report).
- Deliverable 3 — A screenshot of your position on the Kaggle competition leaderboard for your top-performing model.
